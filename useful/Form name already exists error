Form name already exists error

this one:
https://adsapi.io/admin/ads/f5e9674a-d389-43f0-aa91-9e562537cfe4

verified that it wasn't a permissions thing by claiming the facebook page which then revealed this error.

Go check it on BM, claim the page first!  (in this case for Ad_forms)

Bug where uniqueness is now a requirement on ad_form name?  emailed Jay.
